# TF2ChatMenuGenerator
Generates a menu like the voice menu for TF2.

I mainly uploaded this so people wouldn't say I've shared a virus. 
You can download the build [here]{https://github.com/Tvde1/TF2ChatMenuGenerator/raw/master/TF2ChatMenuGenerator/bin/Debug/TF2ChatMenuGenerator.exe). Or you can simply download the code and build it for yourself.
